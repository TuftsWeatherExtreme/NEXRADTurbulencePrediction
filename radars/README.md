# Radar Scripts

## NEXRAD

For our project, we used Next Generation Weather Radar Data (NEXRAD) as the
input to our machine learning model. Specifically, we used the level 2 product
**reflectivity**. To acquire this data, we had to perform several queries to
the Amazon S3 bucket found 
[here](https://noaa-nexrad-level2.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). 
*Most* of the data is stored in the following format:
```
{YEAR}/{MONTH}/{DAY}/{SITE_CODE}/{SITE_CODE}{YEAR}{MONTH}{DAY}_{HHMMSS}_VO6"
```
Where `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` are numerical, e.g., `YEAR = 2025`, 
`MONTH = 01`, and `DAY = 14` would be one possible setup. Site code is one of
of the 159 NEXRAD site codes. These are all 4 capital letters that begin with
'K'. For example, `KBUF` is the site code of the radar for Buffalo, New York.

## Processing the Data w/ [get_radars_for_pirep.py](get_radars_for_pirep.py)
We wrote a helpful script called 
[get_radars_for_pirep.py](get_radars_for_pirep.py) which accepts a csv of pilot
reports (produced from [clean_pireps.py](/pireps/clean_pireps.py)) and 
determines the closest 5 radars to each pirep. This uses the 
[nexrad_sites.csv](nexrad_sites.csv) to find the location of the 159
NEXRAD sites in the Continental United States. One result of
[get_radars_for_pirep.py](get_radars_for_pirep.py) is to add a column called 
`nexrad_sites` to the csv of pilot reports to store the site codes of the 5 
closest radar sites.

After determining the closest radars (spatially), we must determine the closest
scan temporally. This requires listing the contents of the s3 bucket as found
above and storing the filenames locally. We then use the times given in the
filename (the `HHMMSS` portion) to determine the most recent radar scan for
each pilot report, for each of the 5 spatially closest radars. Once we determine
which file represents the most recent radar scan, we store the file path to the
file in the s3 bucket in our csv.

### Usage
Run with
```
python get_radars_for_pirep.py [-month MONTH] [-year YEAR] [-o {FILE/STDOUT}]
```
If month or year are not specified, this script expects the
csv through stdin. The `-o` should be followed by either `FILE` or `STDOUT`, 
and this indicates the location to output the new csv to. If `FILE` is
specified, this script will output to 
[radars/pirep_w_radar_data/{YEAR}/{MONTH}.csv](/radars/pirep_w_radar_data/2024/02.csv).
`MONTH` must be one of "january, february, ..., december", and year must be
of the format `YYYY` (e.g., 2025). One example usage of the script would be:
```
python get_radars_for_pirep.py -month february -year 2024 -o FILE
```
The output of this run can be found in [02.csv](/radars/pirep_w_radar_data/2024/02.csv)
Another example can be seen here:
```
cat pireps/clean_pirep_data/2025/03_turb_pireps.csv |
python radars/get_radars_for_pirep.py -o STDOUT > radars/pirep_with_radar_data/2025/03.csv
```
This piping feature is useful and we use it in our [generate_csv_data.sh](hpc_scripts/data_processing/generate_csv_data.sh)

### Example
Here are some example values for the two columns the [get_radars_for_pirep.py](get_radars_for_pirep.py) script adds to the final csv:

```
nexrad_sites: "('KJGX', 'KVAX', 'KFFC', 'KCLX', 'KTLH')",
aws_files: "['s3://noaa-nexrad-level2/2024/01/31/KJGX/KJGX20240131_235419_V06',
             's3://noaa-nexrad-level2/2024/01/31/KVAX/KVAX20240131_235731_V06', 
             's3://noaa-nexrad-level2/2024/01/31/KFFC/KFFC20240131_235614_V06', 
             's3://noaa-nexrad-level2/2024/01/31/KCLX/KCLX20240131_235840_V06', 
             's3://noaa-nexrad-level2/2024/01/31/KTLH/KTLH20240131_235416_V06']"
```
As can be seen, for the given pilot report at 29500 feet, 
32.40ยบ latitude, and -83.21ยบ longitude, the 5 closest radar sites are:
```
KJGX: Southeast of Atlanta
KVAX: South Georgia
KFFC: Atlanta
KCLX: Charleston South Carolina
KTLH: Tallahassee
```
The pilot report is in fact located southeast of Atlanta, and this specific
report can be found on the first line of 
[02.csv](/pireps/clean_pirep_data/2024/02.csv). This pilot report took place
at midnight on February 1st 2024, so the closest radar scans in the past are:
```
KJGX: 20240131_235419_V06
KVAX: 20240131_235731_V06
KFFC: 20240131_235614_V06
KCLX: 20240131_235840_V06
KTLH: 20240131_235416_V06
```
That is, 23:54:19 on January 31st for the KJGX station.

## Accessing the Data
We use [PyART](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/index.html) to read NEXRAD data. 
To install PyART, you can run `pip install arm_pyart` 
(NOT `pip install pyart`!). PyART has a ton of useful functions and classes
for manipulating, accessing, and visualizing the radar data. One of these
downloaded radar files can be found in 
[raw_radar_data](raw_radar_data/KJGX20240131_235419_V06).

### [reflect_over_cutoff.py](reflect_over_cutoff.py)
To get our bearings with the `Radar` object provided by PyART, we wrote
[reflect_over_cutoff.py](reflect_over_cutoff.py). This script takes takes a 
NEXRAD VO6 file and a cutoff reflectivity value and creates a csv file
containing the longitude, latitude, and altitude of all instances of 
reflectivity above this cutoff in the given VO6 file. 

#### Usage
```
python reflect_over_cutoff.py raw_radar_data/KJGX20240131_235419_V06 20
```

## Gridding the data [create_grid.py](create_grid.py)
The next step in our data pipeline involves gridding our NEXRAD data around
a particular pilot report. After running 
[clean_pireps.py](../pireps/clean_pireps.py) and sending the output to
[get_radars_for_pirep.py](get_radars_for_pirep.py), we have the requisite
data to grid our nexrad data around a pilot report to create an input to our
machine learning model.
